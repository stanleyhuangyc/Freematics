Freematics ESPRIT is an Arduino compatible development board based on Espressif ESP32 SoC with additional features for telematics projects. The board leads out nearly all I/O pins from ESP32 into standard Arduino factor, making it familiar to Arduino players and also compatible with some existing Arduino shields.
