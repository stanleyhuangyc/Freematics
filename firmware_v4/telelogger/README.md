This sketch turns a Freematics ONE device into a wireless (GPRS) vehicle data collector and transmitter. The live data of a car, including OBD-II, GPS and MEMS sensor data, is collected in realtime, cached in SRAM and pushed to a HTTP server by HTTP POST continuously.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Freematics ONE with SIM800L - http://freematics.com/products/freematics-one
* Arduino IDE (for compiling and uploading the code)
* A micro SIM card
* A car with OBD-II port
